  Putnam3145:
  - bugfix: rad collectors display the right units now
  - balance: Stasis beds are now 90% as good as surgery tables for surgery
2022-08-02:
  SandPoot:
  - admin: Alphabetically ordered bitfields for admin editing.

  BongaTheProto:
  - tweak: normalizer wristbands now go in the wrist slot

  - rscadd: Adds more AI screens on box
  Putnam3145:
  - balance: Research bomb "midpoint" at which it's worth exactly 50000 points from
      240->300
  - code_imp: doesn't snowflake the bomb cap for linux anymore, servers that need
      to tweak it can do it themselves (I didn't even put it down right, should be
      5000 instead of 50000, yikes)

  Hatterhat:
  - tweak: The L6 Squad Automatic Weapon, as used by Syndicate nuclear operatives,
      now fires 7.12x82mm, with no change in ballistic performance. This has the side
      effect of making it now capable of utilizing match-grade ammunition, which some
      would think are mutually incompatible concepts.
  Putnam3145:
  - tweak: Untied shoelaces probabilities rework
  - balance: Miner boots are slightly harder to tie/untie now

      characters, up from 140.
  - tweak: Recoil now pushes your screen in the opposite direction of where you're
      shooting. It makes sense in context, I swear. Adjust the setting for this in
      your client prefs, because it defaults to on.
  Linzolle:
  - bugfix: catwalk overlays behave properly, appearing on top of cables and such
  Putnam3145:
  - tweak: Various gases now have shortened names for filters
  - balance: Nitric oxide now removes from the power mix like nitrogen/pluoxium do
  - balance: Nitric oxide now becomes, at most, 20% nitrogen dioxide instead of 50%
  - rscadd: 'Adds station traits: Small modifiers that can randomly be chosen each
      round. They are usually logged in the intercept the station receives early in
      the round'
  - refactor: Announcement audio is now stored in a datum to make it easy to add different
      announcers
  SandPoot:
  - bugfix: Fixed the lack of eyes making ERROR appear on people.
  - qol: Set up for the dmi editor extension, very helpful as you can see the existant
      states and their names opposed to only images in a huge spritesheet.
