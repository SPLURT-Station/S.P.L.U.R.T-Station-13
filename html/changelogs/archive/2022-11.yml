  - code_imp: Rewrites "Set Gender" for simple mobs and silicon as an upward proc
      for "mob/living", while makes previous verbs to call for the proc instead. While
      it'll help with verbs now sharing the same function (and thus easier to edit),
      I am not sure if it will help with duplicate code.
  BongaTheProto:
  - rscadd: Adds the Narrate (Player) verb in the IC tab
  - rscadd: Also, /me's can now be multiline, because apparently no one did a CL for
      it
  - rscadd: Adds a new kind of horns (Alien bobbers) and a new dress you can find
      in the autodrobe

  - bugfix: made the vampire heal toxin in coffins so its alot easier to revive them
